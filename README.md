# Real-Time Traffic Light Detection

Real-Time Object Detection: Utilizes YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) for high-performance, real-time traffic light detection. The model efficiently identifies traffic light states (red, yellow, green) by processing images with minimal latency, leveraging the latest advancements in CNN architecture.

Optimized Model for Accuracy: Trains YOLOv8 on a custom dataset of traffic light images, fine-tuning the model with data augmentation and transfer learning techniques to improve accuracy and robustness under various lighting and environmental conditions.

Technologies Used: YOLOv8, Python, OpenCV, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Image Processing
